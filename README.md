# Weather Forecast Web Application

This is a simple weather forecast web application developed as a mini project.
The application demonstrates front-end development concepts using HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript.

## Features
- City-based weather search
- Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and AQI
- Responsive user interface
- JavaScript-based logic with simulated weather data

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Note
This project uses simulated (dummy) weather data for learning and demonstration
purposes. It does not fetch real-time data from external APIs.

## Future Scope
- Integration with real weather APIs
- AI/ML-based weather prediction using historical data
